Using the Hyperion Essbase script language, do the following:

 1. For Business Unit 10200 and Department 12300, create a basic calculation script where you calculate the Final Budget amount of 400100 from the rate of 400100 
 multiplied by the base of 600100 for each period in the 2019 Fiscal Year.
 
FIX (400100Rate @DESCENDANTS(10200))
	CALC DIM (Month, 400100Rate)
ENDFIX

FIX (Budget @DESCENDANTS(10200)
	CALC DIM (Month * Budget*400100Rate)
ENDFIX
	
 
 2. Create a script where you aggregate BusUnit and Departments for Budget, Final, Amount, 2019, all periods, all accounts.
FIX (Business Unit, Department)
	CALC (DIM Budget, Final, Amount, 2019, Accounts)
ENDFIX
